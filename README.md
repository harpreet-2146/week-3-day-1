guess someone is procastinating
no cause I had a valid reason to not commit today 
I dont feel like getting out of bed 
8/5 i feel so overwhelmed and horrible rn 
my result has been withheld 
i feel like puking and kms 
my stomach hurts so much 
the entire situation is all over the place 
i dont think i can hold onto life anymore
