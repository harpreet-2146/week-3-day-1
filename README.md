guess someone is procastinating
no cause I had a valid reason to not commit today 
I dont feel like getting out of bed 
8/5 i feel so overwhelmed and horrible rn 
my result has been withheld 
i feel like puking and kms 
my stomach hurts so much 
the entire situation is all over the place 
i dont think i can hold onto life anymore 
9/5 ive given up and this project is an absolute fail
huge blunder from sheriyans coding school and im really disappointed 
everything has fallen apart 
the 15k, paper cancel, backlog, now this 
been working on it for so long 
im really disappointed with life 
my chest hurts 
i cant go on in life anymore 
this is my 100th contribution this year btw 
and here i am ranting in the readme file 
i no longer wanna do anything in life 
its a waste 
im done and i wanna end it
